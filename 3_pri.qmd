# 3 Privacy and data governance (PRI)

Closely linked to the principle of prevention of harm is privacy, a fundamental right particularly affected by AI systems. Prevention of harm to privacy also necessitates adequate data governance that covers the quality and integrity of the data used, its relevance in light of the domain in which the AI systems will be deployed, its access protocols and the capability to process data in a manner that protects privacy. 

## 3.1 P**rivacy and data protection**

Like many technologies, AI systems can equally enable and hamper fundamental rights. They can benefit people for instance by helping them track their personal data, or by increasing the accessibility of education, hence supporting their right to education. However, given the reach and capacity of AI systems, they can also negatively affect fundamental rights. In situations where such risks exist, a fundamental rights impact assessment should be undertaken. This should be done prior to the system’s development and include an evaluation of whether those risks can be reduced or justified as necessary in a democratic society in order to respect the rights and freedoms of others. Moreover, mechanisms should be put into place to receive external feedback regarding AI systems that potentially infringe on fundamental rights.

## 3.2 P**rivacy and data protection**

The quality of the data sets used is paramount to the performance of AI systems. When data is gathered, it may contain socially constructed biases, inaccuracies, errors and mistakes. This needs to be addressed prior to training with any given data set. In addition, the integrity of the data must be ensured. Feeding malicious data into an AI system may change its behaviour, particularly with self-learning systems. Processes and data sets used must be tested and documented at each step such as planning, training, testing and deployment. This should also apply to AI systems that were not developed in-house but acquired elsewhere.

## **3.3 Access to data**

In any given organisation that handles individuals’ data (whether someone is a user of the system or not), data protocols governing data access should be put in place. These protocols should outline who can access data and under which circumstances. Only duly qualified personnel with the competence and need to access individual’s data should be allowed to do so.
