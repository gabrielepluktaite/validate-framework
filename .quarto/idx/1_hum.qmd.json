This requires that AI systems should both act as enablers to a democratic, flourishing and equitable society by supporting the user’s agency and foster fundamental rights and allow for human oversight.\n\n## 1.1 Fundamental rights\n\nLike many technologies, AI systems can equally enable and hamper fundamental rights. They can benefit people for instance by helping them track their personal data, or by increasing the accessibility of education, hence supporting their right to education. However, given the reach and capacity of AI systems, they can also negatively affect fundamental rights. In situations where such risks exist, a fundamental rights impact assessment should be undertaken. This should be done prior to the system’s development and include an evaluation of whether those risks can be reduced or justified as necessary in a democratic society in order to respect the rights and freedoms of others. Moreover, mechanisms should be put into place to receive external feedback regarding AI systems that potentially infringe on fundamental rights.\n\n***None of the identified requirements could be mapped to this category. Other than the requirements addressed in related sections such as privacy, we believe that our tool does not influence fundamental rights.***\n\n## 1.2 Human Agency\n\nUsers should be able to make informed autonomous decisions regarding AI systems. They should be given the knowledge and tools to comprehend and interact with AI systems to a satisfactory degree and, where possible, be enabled to reasonably self-assess or challenge the system. AI systems should support individuals in making better, more informed choices in accordance with their goals. AI systems can sometimes be deployed to shape and influence human behaviour through mechanisms that may be difficult to detect, since they may harness sub-conscious processes, including various forms of unfair manipulation, deception, herding and conditioning, all of which may threaten individual autonomy. The overall principle of user autonomy must be central to the system’s functionality. Key to this is the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing when this produces legal effects on users or similarly significantly affects them.\n\n### Requirement 12-1-HUM {#12-1-hum}\n\n**Description:** ***\\[Relevant methods\\]*** for measuring model uncertainty are implemented to provide a confidence level for predictions in the app available at ***\\[time point\\]***.\n\n| **Parameter**        | **Values**                            |\n|----------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| **Relevant Methods** | To be defined by Owner                |\n| **Time Point**       | By the start of the prospective study |\n\n**Phases**: development, testing, validation\n\n**Owner**\n\n-   WP 2 lead\n\n**Stakeholders**\n\n-   WP 2 (ML)\n-   WP 3 (design)\n-   WP 4 (clinical validation)\n-   Other: medical staff\n\n::: {style=\"background-color:#abebc6; padding:10px; border-radius:5px;\"}\n**Tolerable**\n\n-   ***All*** of the relevant methods: ***to be defined by Owner*** for measuring model uncertainty are used to provide a confidence interval for predictions in the app available at ***start of the prospective study***.\n:::\n\n### Requirement 12-2-HUM {#12-2-hum}\n\n**Description:** In the events where there is a clear conflict between the predictions of the tool and the medical opinion of the doctor, a process protocol for epistemic authority dilemmas customized for ***\\[physician expertise level\\]*** can be followed.

Oversight may be achieved through governance mechanisms such as a human-in-the-loop (HITL), human-on-the-loop (HOTL), or human-in-command (HIC) approach.  \n\n**HITL** refers to the capability for human intervention in every decision cycle of the system, which in many cases is neither possible nor desirable.  \n\n**HOTL** refers to the capability for human intervention during the design cycle of the system and monitoring the system’s operation.  \n\n**HIC** refers to the capability to oversee the overall activity of the AI system (including its broader economic, societal, legal and ethical impact) and the ability to decide when and how to use the system in any particular situation. This can include the decision not to use an AI system in a particular situation, to establish levels of human discretion during the use of the system, or to ensure the ability to override a decision made by a system.  \n\nMoreover, it must be ensured that public enforcers have the ability to exercise oversight in line with their mandate. Oversight mechanisms can be required in varying degrees to support other safety and control measures, depending on the AI system’s application area and potential risk. All other things being equal, the less oversight a human can exercise over an AI system, the more extensive testing and stricter governance is required. \n\n### Requirement 13-1-HUM {#13-1-hum}\n\n**Description:** Tool is designed with ***\\[capability needed\\]*** to enable a Human in Command (HIC) governance structure.
