# How Requirements are Organized

Requirements are structured to provide a clear view of their definitions and parameters. Below is an outline detailing how these are organized, articulated through an example of a standard requirement.

## Requirement YZ-N-AAA example

**Description**: Each requirement bears a unique ID, constructed as follows:

\- **YZ**: Sub-chapter numbers reflecting the requirement's area

\- **N**: Sequential number within the sub-chapter

\- **AAA**: The first three letters of the chapter topic

## Parameters
\ The requirement for implementing confidence intervals in predictive modeling might state: 
\ "X of ***\[example parameter\]*** for measuring model uncertainty are implemented to provide a confidence interval for predictions in the app available at ***\[time point\]***".

***\[example parameter\]*** 

\ Parameters listed in brackets are adjustable by the WP 1 team during the project period.

***\[time point\]***

\ This refers to the deadline by which a requirement should be met, typically specifying some due date.

## Phases

Each requirement is mapped to a specific project phase:

**Development**: Focuses on developing the tool's prototype until month 18.

**Testing**: The prototype undergoes testing until month 18.

**Validation**: Begins in month 18, marking the start of validating the developed and tested prototype.

## Stakeholders and Owner

**Stakeholders**: Includes project staff and other relevant groups affected by or necessary for fulfilling the requirement.

**Owner**: Each requirement is assigned an Owner, usually a WP lead relevant to existing tasks. The Owner is responsible for task delegation and execution to meet the requirement.

## Requirement Categorization

Based on the parameterized statements, requirements are classified into three sub-categories:

**Tolerable**: The minimum achievement threshold for a requirement.

**Goal**: Represents the objective aimed to be reached by the project. If both Tolerable and Goal are defined, the project's likely outcome will be between these two.

**Wish**: Desirable outcomes that are aimed for but likely only partially achieved.
